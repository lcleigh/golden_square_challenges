{{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

1. Describe the PROBLEM

 # put or write the user story here. add any notes
> as a user
> so that i can keep track of my tasks
> i want to check if a text includes the string #TODO


2. Design the Method Signature

 # include the name of the method, it's parametere, return value and side effects
    ruby
    task_tracker(text)
    task tracker checks for statement #TODO and returns true / false or a message
    

3. Create examples as texts

 # make a list of examples of what the method will take and return


 # encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list
1. task_tracker("")   => "No text given."
2. ask_tracker("hello my name is Fred")   => "This text does not contain a #TODO item." 
3. task_tracker("hello #TODO clean the house") => "This text contains a #TODO item."
4. task_tracker("hello #todo wash the dishes")   => "This text contains a #TODO item."
 

4. Implement the behaviour

 # after each test you write, follow the TD process of red, green refactor to 
 # implemet the behaviour
